# soft-opengl
An soft implementation of opengles 2.0. 

Well, not 100% implementation, and it't not my goal either. My goal by writing this bunch of code is trying to understand the common graphics pipeline.

## v0.1 release notes

Currently only part of the features of the opengles 2.0 have been implemented:  
1.input assemable  
2.vertex shader  
3.primivite assemable, include culling and clipping(only in xy plane)  
4.rasteriazaion(points,line list, triangle list)
5.pixel shader, only 2d texture sample supported, and event that was not fully testfied.  
6.output merge(not implemented yet!)
